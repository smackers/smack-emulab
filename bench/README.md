SMACK is a *bounded software verifier*, verifying the assertions in its
input programs up to a given bound on loop iterations and recursion depth.
SMACK can verify C programs, such as the following:

    // examples/simple/simple.c
    #include "smack.h"

    int incr(int x) {
      return x + 1;
    }

    int main(void) {
      int a, b;

      a = b = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
      a = incr(a);
      assert(a == b + 1);
      return 0;
    }

The command

    smack.py simple.c

reports that the assertion `a == b + 1` cannot be violated. Besides the
features of this very simple example, SMACK handles every complicated feature
of the C language, including dynamic memory allocation, pointer arithmetic, and
bitwise operations.

Under the hood, SMACK is a translator from the [LLVM](http://www.llvm.org)
compilerâ€™s popular intermediate representation (IR) into the
[Boogie](http://boogie.codeplex.com) intermediate verification language (IVL).
Sourcing LLVM IR exploits an increasing number of compiler front-ends,
optimizations, and analyses. Currently SMACK only supports the C language via
the [Clang](http://clang.llvm.org) compiler, though we are working on providing
support for additional languages. Targeting Boogie exploits a canonical
platform which simplifies the implementation of algorithms for verification,
model checking, and abstract interpretation. Currently, SMACK leverages the
[Boogie](http://boogie.codeplex.com) and [Corral](http://corral.codeplex.com)
verifiers.

Consult [the Wiki](https://github.com/smackers/smack/wiki) for system
requirements, installation, usage, and everything else.
