# This example conf file for a SVCOMP results website was made for apache2 on
# Ubuntu, which was installed with apt-get.  There were no other websites
# configured on the machine where this was created, so this VirtualHost directive
# is the default site on the server.

# If using on Ubuntu with apache2 installed using apt-get, simply put this file
# in /etc/apache2/sites-available/, run `sudo a2ensite 000-default1`, and finally
# restart apache with `service apache2 restart`

# This site definition assumes that apache2 is already properly configured
<VirtualHost *:80>
